1)  Thousands of properties in Louisville are being unused by the public. Whether they are abandoned or unsuable (because of damage from weather, etc.), they are just sitting there. This is not only a lack of efficiency when it comes to using our city's space correctly, but a puts a major damper on the possible beauty that can reside there instead. In the article written by Christina Mora, for WLKY news, she talks about how a few chalkboards have been placed in select spots, specifically around abandoned property near the Russel and Portland area. The more places that bring living space, productivity and  happiness to these areas, the better offeveryone will be. The more living space and productivity, the cheaper the houses are, the more affordable the houses are, the less people will have to leave on the streets.


2)  In 2016, a decent portion of our budget had to go to fixing and repairing our water pipes and plumbing. Louisville water treatment is one of the better ones, for a larger city. However there's always room for improvement. Many areas in the city don't have as easy of access to water as others, specifically when it comes to fire protection.


3) Approximately 30% of Louisville's roads put the populus in danger. According to economic experts, the worse the infrastructure gets in Louisville, the harder it is to get a loan to fix the infrastructure in Louisville. This in turn, would increase our debt, which would decrease our potential to receive a loan. You see the problem? Quoting David Dubofsky, a finance professor at University of Louisville, “Would you rather lend money to a city that has a lot of money, a lot of assets, or would you rather lend money to a city that has a lot of unfulfilled liabilities that they’re going to have to fulfill?" Not only is it a safety hazard to have these roads as depleted as they are, it marks down the opinion the outside world has on us, and the inner community as well.


4) Louisville gets very little money from the transportation throughout the city, in fact, Louisville gets 0 from TARC, which makes 8.1 billion per year. All the transportation in Louisville is funded by the state. Because all the transportation in Louisville is founded and not locally, it doesn't support the economy as much as it could be doing.
