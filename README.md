1)  Thousands of properties in Louisville are being unused by the public. Whether they are abandoned or unsuable (because of damage from weather, etc.), they are just sitting there. This is not only a lack of efficiency when it comes to using our city's space correctly, but a puts a major damper on the possible beauty that can reside there instead. In the article written by Christina Mora, for WLKY news, she talks about how a few chalkboards have been placed in select spots, specifically around abandoned property near the Russel and Portland area. The more places that bring living space, productivity and  happiness to these areas, the happier everyone will be.
